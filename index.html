            <h2>Buck's puzzle page</h2>
            <h3>A place where I don't care about styling</h3>
            I have written some puzzles over the years, you can find all of them here.<br>
            <h3>Singulars</h3>
            <i>Sorted chronologically. These puzzles are written separately 
               and are independent of one another. Qualities of puzzles may vary.</i>
            <ul>
                <li v-for="item in singulars"><a :href="'Puzzles/Singular/' + item.link">{{item.name}}</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Guest Puzzles</h3>
            <i>Sorted chronologically. These puzzles are written by other people.</i><br>
            <i>Some puzzles have a casual version. It makes the puzzle easier,
               but both casual and expert versions should be solvable on its own</i>
