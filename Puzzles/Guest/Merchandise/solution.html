            <h1>Solution to Merchandise</h1>
            <p>
                We are given a list of clues in this puzzle, so we should try to solve them.
                Most clues are ambiguous, but a couple of the easier clues can be solved
                with more confidence, such as "energy range of unexcited electrons",
                "cable tie in Japan", and "a species - a famous one is named Crash".
            </p>

            <p>
                Combined with the flavourtext of this puzzle, we may notice that all answer
                contains the substring "BAND". With this, we can solve all the clues:
            </p>

            <table>
                <tr><td>Clues</td><td>Answers</td><td>Extraction</td></tr>
                <template v-for="(clue, i) in expertClues">
                    <tr>
                        <td>{{clue}}</td>
                        <td>{{answers[i]}}</td>
                        <td>{{answer[i]}}</td>
                    </tr>
                </template>
            </table>

            <p>
                Reading the extracted letter gives the answer <b>COALESCENCE</b>.
            </p>

            <h2>Buck's Note</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to replace the clue for "KESSOKU BAND" with "HUSBAND",
                but I didn't have a good clue for it, and also because the clue is
                a good break-in for being easily searchable and thematic.
            </p>
            <p>
                While writing the solution, I also realised that the romanisation for
                "KESSOKU BAND" is wrong (it should be "KESSOKU BANDO", with the extra
                "O" at the end. While it doesn't affect the solving, I should've 
                replaced the answer with something else.
